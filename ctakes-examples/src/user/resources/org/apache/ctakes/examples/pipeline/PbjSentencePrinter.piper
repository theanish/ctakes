#  This is an example piper file that will spin up a complete pbj pipeline.
#
#  This piper will start the Apache Artemis broker pointed to by the -a parameter on the command line.
#  It will pause for 5 seconds to allow Artemis to fully launch.
#
#  This piper will then launch another instance of Apache cTAKES.
#  That instance of cTAKES will run the third and final bit of the entire PBJ pipeline.
#
#  This piper will then launch a python PBJ bit of the entire pipeline.
#

#
#  To run this pipeline from the command line, use the parameters:
#  -p SentencePrinter
#  -v {python environment Directory}
#  -a {Artemis Broker Directory}
#  -i {Input Document Directory}
#  -o {Output Directory}
#
#  A standard command-line option is the specification of whether or not to pip the ctakes-pbj package.
#  By default ctakes-pbj will be pip ed at the beginning of a run.  You can turn this off with:
#  --pipPbj no
#
